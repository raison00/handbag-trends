This README is the page/feature/component consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation.
The consumer wants a page/feature/component to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what your feature or component does.

Your job is to

1) tell them what it is (with context)
2) show them what it looks like in action
3) show them how they use it
        clearly document the feature or component API, either radio channel api for feature, or public methods for component.
4) tell them any other relevant details


Please refer to the Art of the README for more detailed instructions
